/*
Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE to see received numbers.
The ESP will toggle its LED based on the received number.

Debugging options:
    Check Serial Ports:
        ls /dev/tty*
    Ensure correct baud rate in both devices (9600 in this case).
    Use a USB-TTL converter to debug the ESPâ€™s serial output.
